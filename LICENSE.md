## LZW Decompression

The author has provided an own implementation of the LZW decompression
clearly believing the older patents are no longer in force. Excerpts from
reference article from [GNU Website](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gif.html)
provided here for reference:

> There is no special patent threat to GIF format nowadays as far as we know; 
> the patents that were used to attack GIF have expired. Nonetheless, this 
> article will remain pertinent as long as programs can be forbidden by patents,
> since the same sorts of things could happen in any area of computing. See our 
> web site policies regarding GIFs, and our web guidelines.

> We were able to search the patent databases of the USA, Canada, Japan, and
> the European Union. The Unisys patent expired on 20 June 2003 in the USA, 
> in Europe it expired on 18 June 2004, in Japan the patent expired on 20 June
> 2004 and in Canada it expired on 7 July 2004. The U.S. IBM patent expired 11
> August 2006. The Software Freedom Law Center says that after 1 October 2006,
> there will be no significant patent claims interfering with the use of static
> GIFs.

> Animated GIFs are a different story. We do not know what patents might cover
