Implementations of the PDF writers are not always to the specification or they may even vary significantly from vendor to vendor. Everytime, you get a new PDF file there is a possibility that it may not work to the best interpretation of the specification. A script based language makes it easier for the consumers to quickly modify the code and enhance to their specific needs. \nWhen a higher level scripting language implements a C/C++ PDF library API, the scope is confined to achieving certain high level application tasks like,  graphics or text extraction; annotation or signature content extraction or  page merging or extraction. However, this API represents the PDF  specification as a model (in MVC parlance). Every object in PDF  specification can be represented in some form through these APIs. Hence,  objects can be utilized effectively to understand document structure or  correlate documents in more meaningful ways. \nPotential to be extended as a PDF generator.

Unlike, PostScript which is a Turing complete programming language, PDF is a file format. The operators in PDF do not leave a side effect on an execution stack, that can be further exploited by the subsequent operators. While one need not have full understanding of PostScript to understand PDF general complexities of a page description language (PDL)  like PostScript are seen in PDFs as well. Here are a few simple scenarios of similarities and dissimilarities of PDF vs PostScript are presented here. This will help you understand the design principles of PDF.","category":"page"},{"location":"arch/#","page":"Architecture and Design","title":"Architecture and Design","text":"Execution Order and Page: PostScript is an execution engine. It would execute the code as the operators are received and results are left on the execution stack as side-effects. Depending on the device rendering capabilities, PostScript would load the rendered output to the device on a call of showpage. PDF does not have the flexibility of execution of a programming language. Generally, PDF content are organized as page objects. The content to be rendered and the resources (fonts and images) are associated with a page. Moreover, the content is rendered in the order in which they appear. Unless otherwise specified, the ink is considered opaque. Thus a content rendered later may overwrite the content rendered earlier if there is an overlap.\nContent Order vs. Reading Order: PDLs focus on final look and feel of the output and not the reading order of the text or artifacts. For example, fonts tend to be an expensive resource to load at least under low memory conditions. Once loaded an execution engine may like to render all the content utilizing the font resource earlier than render the artifacts in the reading order. A document optimized for such purpose will tend to organize all text utilizing a specific fonts at one place.\nContent Objects vs. Non-Content Objects: Without getting much into the definition complexities, we can state a content leaves an artifact on a page and is rendered. While some other objects may affect the user interface or provide additional document metadata information and they are not rendered on a PDF page. One example will be PDF outlines or navigation links. They only are shown on a user interface and not on a rendered page.\nRandom vs. Sequential Access: PDF files are designed for random access of the document. You can get to any page and access the contents of the page. While PostScript was not designed for that purpose. It typically will be loaded once and executed.","category":"page"},{"location":"arch/#PDF-specification-ISO-32000-1-and-ISO-32000-2-1","page":"Architecture and Design","title":"PDF specification ISO-32000-1 and ISO-32000-2","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"arch/#","page":"Architecture and Design","title":"Architecture and Design","text":"The API is developed around PDF specification, notably around ISO-32000-1, that can be downloaded from Adobe.

Normally, certificate authorities (root as well as intermediate) are represented in the trust store.\nPresence of an end-entity certificate in the Trust Store ensures that the chain validation for the certificate does not have to be carried out. However, this is not considered a good practice for certificates as the certificate validation is an important attribute to avoid security breaches in the chain. In case of self-signed certificates with not CA capabilities this may be the only option. \nValidation of digital signatures are limited to the approval signature validation as per section 12.8.1 of PDF Spec. 1.7. Signatures for permissions and usage rights are not validated as per this method. This API only provides a validation report. It does not modify access to any parts of the document based on the validation output. The consumer of the API needs to take appropriate action based on the validation report as desired in their applications.\nRevocation - When time is embedded in the signature as signing-time attribute or a signed timestamp or PDF sigature dictionary has M attribute, then those are picked up for validation. However, revocation information are not used during validation.\nPDF 2.0 Support - The support is only experimental. While some subfilters like /ETSI.CAdES.detached are supported.

PDF is designed to be accessed in a random access order. Some of the objects in PDF like fonts can be referred from multiple page objects. To address these concerns objects are provided reference identifiers and mappings are provided from various locations in the PDF files. Moreover, to reduce the size of the files, the objects are put inside stream containers and can be compressed. Access to a specific object reference may need several lookups before the actual object can be traced. All these lead to a fairly complex arrangement of objects. CosDoc wraps all the object reference schemes and provide a simplified API called cosDocGetObject and simplifies object look up.  Thus any PDF object can be classified into the following forms based on how they are represented in a document:\n\nDirect Objects: Direct objects are defined where they are referred or used. \nIndirect Objects: Indirect objects have reference identifiers, there location in a PDF document is described through a Object Reference identifier.\n\nOne can access any aspect of PDF using the COS level APIs alone.

This is called as indirect object referencing. However, to extract actual information one needs access to the complete object (direct object). This method provides access to the direct object after searching for the object in the document structure. If an indirect object reference is passed as obj parameter the complete indirect object (reference as well as all content of the object) are returned. A direct object passed to the method is returned as is without any translation. This ensures the user does not have to go through checking the type of the objects before accessing the contents.\n\nExample\n\njulia> cosDocGetObject(doc.cosDoc, CosIndirectObjectRef(555, 0))\n\n555 0 obj\n<<\n\t/Count\t18\n\t/Last\t629 0 R\n\t/First\t556 0 R\n>>\nendobj\n\njulia> cosDocGetObject(doc.cosDoc, cn\"DirectObject\")\n/DirectObject\n\n\n\n\n\n    cosDocGetObject(doc::CosDoc, dict::CosObject, key::Union{CosName, CosNullType}) -> CosObject\n\nReturns the object referenced inside the dict dictionary.\n\ndict can be a PDF dictionary object reference or an indirect object or  a direct CosDict object.\nkey can be CosNull as well.
